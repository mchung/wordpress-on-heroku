<span class="boldtext">2. Have you watched the video tutorials? </span>
<div class="indent"><p>Many of the common issues that occur have already been covered in the video tutorials section of the members area. To access the video tutorials page <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/members-area/tutorials">log in here</a>. </p>
</div>

<span class="boldtext">3. Do you have plugins active that did not come with the theme? </span>
<div class="indent"><p>If you are using additional plugins that did not come with the theme it is possible that one of them is interfering with the design. Unfortunately it is impossible to predict what will happen when unknown code is place into my themes, so it is always important, if you are experiencing problems, to disable all of the plugins that did not come with the theme to see if they are at fault. Try disabling each plugin one by one to find the culprit. </p></div>

<span class="boldtext">4. Have you uploaded the correct theme folder to the correct theme directory? </span>
<div class="indent"><p>When you download one of my themes and unzip it you will see a few different folders. Photoshop Files, Plugins, Theme, and, with select themes, Fonts. The &quot;theme folder&quot; that you need to upload to your server is located within the Theme folder in your ZIP file. You need to upload this folder to the correct folder on your server (wp-content/themes/). Do not upload the &quot;Theme&quot; folder, only upload the folder within the &quot;Theme&quot; folder. For example, if you are using my Studioblue theme you would want to upload the &quot;StudioBlue&quot; folder contained within the &quot;Theme&quot; folder to wp-content/themes. Do not upload StudioBlue's parent folder. Furthermore, make sure that you do not rename the &quot;StudioBlue&quot; folder.

<span class="boldtext">5. Are you using the latest version of Wordpress? </span>
<div class="indent"><p>Wordpress is constantly changing, it is always best to keep your Wordpress install up-to-date. Using an out-dated version may lead to unknown problems. </p></div>

<span class="boldtext">6. Have you made any customizations to the theme? </span>
<div class="indent"><p>Before contacting me about theme problems make sure customizations you made are not the cause of the problem. If you have made edits to the theme files, try uploading a fresh version of the theme and compare the two.</p></div>

<span class="boldtext">7. Are you having trouble getting your thumbnails to appear? </span>
